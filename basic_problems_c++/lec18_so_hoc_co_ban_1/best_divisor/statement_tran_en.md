# Best Divisor

Huang is a girl who loves numbers. She often comes up with different ways to compare them. Today, Huang, herself, created a concept of "goodness" of a number as follows:

- Consider two positive integers $a$ and $b,$ the number with a bigger sum of digits is the better one.
- If the two numbers have the same sum of digits, the smaller one is the better one.

***Task:*** Given a positive integer $n$, help Huang to find the "best" one among all the positive integer divisors of $n$.

## Input

- A single line contains the positive integer $n$.

## Constraints

- $1 \le n \le 10^9$.

## Subtasks

- Subtask $1$ ($30\%$ of the points): $1 \le n \le 10^5$.
- Subtask $2$ ($70\%$ of the points): Original constraints.

## Output

- Print the best positive divisor of $n$.
