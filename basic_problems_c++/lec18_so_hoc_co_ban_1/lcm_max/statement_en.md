# Least Common Multiple (LCM)

You are given two positive integers $A$ and $B$.

***Task:*** Find the smallest positive integer $X$ satisfying: $X≤B$ and the least common multiple of $X$ and $A$ is the largest. Print the value of that least common multiple.

## Input

- The first line contains a positive integer $T$ - number of test cases.
- $T$ lines follow. Each line contains two positive integers $A$ and $B$.

## Constraints

- $1≤T ≤ 10^5$.
- $1≤A,B ≤ 3×10^9$. 

## Output

- Print $T$ lines. The $i$-$th$ should be the result for the $i$-$th$ test case.
